### Major Changes

- Initial public release! I’ve been developing this package for about six months in a private mono‑repo for another project. I now use it in all of my current projects that have a Node.js backend and I can't imagine handling environment variables any other way at this point. That said, I've decided to open‑source the library for anyone who may find it useful. More docs and examples to come soon!
